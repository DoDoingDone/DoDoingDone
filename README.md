- 👋 I’m @DoDoingDone!
- 👀 I've been cramming on Udemy and working to become a front end developer.
- 🌱 I'm studying HTML and CSS, (no JS yet) and really want to excel in advanced CSS later. It's a magic language, and a heckuva lot of fun!
- 💞️ Collaborating on anything that will improve my skills is on the radar. Right now I'm still working on being useful.
- 📫 How to reach me? 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/ her works. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was an elephant stablehand at one time, long ago. Yep.
